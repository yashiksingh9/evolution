# evolution
3.5 billion year journey of life , but digital 

STAGE 1 [ cell ]: program reproducing abilities for self preservation
(eg. bacteria)
(this program is more like the grass or plants who get energy from sun, so basically it dont need to hunt to stay alive.)
(will be getting fed by stage 2 cell)

STAGE 2 [ cell ]: same as stage 2, but this one will need to eat to survive... 
(eg. a lion)
(this program need to find stage 1 cell(primary cell)and get the digital enrgy defined in stage one cell then add it to itself for staying alive more)
(no food no life, therefore dead)
(will be feeding on stage 1 cell)
(these cells would maintain the the exponential growth of stage one cell and help system not to crash by too many of stage 1 cells.)
(these wont be reproducing like stage one cells)
(there reproduction will be upto themself or the situation they are in.. there they would be a bit smarter than stage 2 cells.)

************here we created the first digital biological stable system of very primitive early unicellular organisms in history of earth***********

***stage one cell have been uploaded and stage 2 is being made***

***further stages would not be showed for now but stay connected for future updates***
